# Crud with React
this is a basic todo app to practice crud functionality with React. My plan is to eventually reuse parts of this to build a kanban app with react. Some of the things I like about this app are the overall simplicity and the click to edit which also autofocuses. This could also be a good template for learning to use a css framework like tailwind.
